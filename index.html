		<h1>Why should you Hike?</h1>
			<h2>Good for the Physical</h2>
				<p> Hiking is a great way to stay active. Staying active is good for your health and hiking is extremely 
					beginner friendly. People often start slowly, then the more they hike the more endurance that is built up. </p>
			<h2>Good for the Mental</h2>
				<p>Another reason to Hike is its benefits on mental health. It can really help for people to reconnect 
					with nature and clear their minds. Studies show that most people who hike live calmer lives than those who donâ€™t.</p>
			<h2>The Views are Stunning</h2>
				<p>The best part of every hike is the View at the end. It is the culmination of all of the hard work that the 
					hiker has put into the trip. Here are some examples of some of the best views I have seen, but remember that nothing beats the real thing.</p>
